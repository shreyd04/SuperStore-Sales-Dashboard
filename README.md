****SuperStore Global Analytics: End-to-End Profitability & Unit Economics ****

Analyzed 50,000+ global transactions to identify profitability leakages and supply chain inefficiencies. By bridging the gap between raw data engineering and financial planning (FP&A), I developed a suite of KPIs focused on Operating Profit, Average Order Value (AOV), and Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) to provide actionable insights for executive decision-making.

**** Tech Stack****

**Data Engineering**: SQL (PostgreSQL) - Window Functions, CTEs, Data Cleaning.

**Data Visualization**: Tableau Public - Dual Axis Charts, LOD Expressions, Action Filters.

**Unit Economics**: Financial Modeling concepts (COGS, Operating Margin, AOV).

****Business Logic & KPIs Explained****
In this project, I moved beyond simple "Sales" reporting to focus on Efficiency Metrics:

**Operating Profit**: Calculated by subtracting Outbound Shipping costs from Gross Profit to determine true regional health.

**AOV (Average Order Value)**: Analyzed to identify if high revenue was driven by volume or high-ticket items.

**COGS vs. Profit**: Visualized the relationship between direct product costs and net margins to identify "High-Volume, Low-Value" products.

**Average Operating Margin %** : 

**Total Number of Orders** :

**Top Performing Region** :
