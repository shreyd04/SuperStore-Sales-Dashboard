# SuperStore Global Analytics: End-to-End Profitability & Unit Economics

Analyzed 50,000+ global transactions to identify profitability leakages and supply chain inefficiencies. By bridging the gap between raw data engineering and financial planning (FP&A), I developed a suite of KPIs focused on Operating Profit, Average Order Value (AOV), and Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) to provide actionable insights for executive decision-making.

 ## Tech Stack

 ### Data Engineering: SQL (PostgreSQL) - Window Functions, CTEs, Data Cleaning.

### Data Visualization: Tableau Public - Dual Axis Charts, LOD Expressions, Action Filters.

### Unit Economics: Financial Modeling concepts (COGS, Operating Margin, AOV).

## Business Objective 

The objective of this project is to analyze a global retail sales portfolio to understand revenue drivers, profitability patterns, and key risk indicators using SQL, Python, and Tableau.

The analysis follows a financial and FP&A-style approach by defining KPIs, performing trend and segmentation analysis, and identifying how discounting, shipping cost, and customer segments impact overall portfolio performance

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains 10,000+ orders with information on sales, profit, discount, shipping cost, customer segments, markets, and categories across multiple years.

## KPI Framework Used

i Total Revenue

ii Total Profit

iii Profit Margin

vi Average Order Value (AOV)

v Discount %

vi Shipping Cost impact

## Analysis Performed in Python (before Tableau)

#### Before visualization, Python was used to:

i Clean and convert raw data types

ii Compute KPI metrics

iii Perform yearly trend analysis

iv Analyze profitability by category, segment, and country

v Identify discount and shipping cost impact on profit

vi Prepare cleaned analytical tables for dashboarding
